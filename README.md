# Planetside2-Base-Maps
Renders of bases from Planetside2 free to use for any pourpose 

For now I'm adding bases rendered in a top down format in order to be used by teams who are taking part in the competitive side of the game but in the future, if real life permits it, I'll try to add every base of the game.

Still a WIP, if specific bases are needed write me on discord: @_botta_

software used:
- Blender for rendering the models 
- https://github.com/ryanjsims/warpgate for extracting models 

IMPORTANT:
the software made by ryanjsims to extract the zones from game files has a hard time placing objects where they need to be or with the right rotation. 
I try to correct every error and make the render as precise as possible but some parts may not be corresponding 100% to the game.
