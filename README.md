# Planetside2-Base-Maps
List of Renders for each base of Planetside2 free to use for any pourpose 

Still a WIP, if specific bases are needed write me on discord @_botta_

IMPORTANT:
the software made by ryanjsims to extract the zones from game files has a hard time placing rocks where they need to be or with the right rotation. 
I try to correct every error and make the render as precise as possible but some parts may not be corresponding 100% to the game.

software used:
- blender for rendering the models 
- https://github.com/ryanjsims/warpgate for extracting models
